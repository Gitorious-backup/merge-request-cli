Gitorious CLI
==========

Provide a CLI interface to merge requests in your Gitorious
repository: list merge requests, open them in a browser etc.

Installation
----------

The git-merge-requests script should be put into a directory in your
PATH, after which you may use is as a Git command.


Requirements
----------

The tool is written in Ruby, and requires the following libraries:

* rubygems
* nokogiri

Issues/TODO
----------

Lots! A non-documented issue is that we assume the Git remote on
Gitorious is named "origin".
